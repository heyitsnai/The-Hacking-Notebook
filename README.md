# The Hacking Notebook

### hey there.

Welcome to _The Hacking Notebook_â€”a living documentation of my journey into the world of hacking. This gitbook serves as both a record of my learning and a tool to deepen my understanding, blending insights from various sources and personal discoveries along the way.&#x20;

My hope is that what I learn and share here can be as valuable to others as it is to me. Whether you're here for reference, fresh perspectives, or just curious, I hope you find something useful. Enjoy the journey!
