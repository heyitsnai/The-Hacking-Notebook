  requests to unintended locations, potentially exposing sensitive data.

# SSRF

**Typical Attack Scenario:** In an SSRF attack, an attacker can trick the server into access internal services or external systems. This can lead to unauthorized access to internal data.&#x20;

**SSRF Against the Server:** Attackers can force the server to make requests to itself (localhost or 127.0.0.1). For example, an attacker might modify an HTTP request parameter:

```
stockApi=http://127.0.0.1/admin
```

If /admin is restricted to local access, the server may retrieve it directly, bypassing usual access controls and revealing administrative functionality.&#x20;

### Why does this work?&#x20;

* **Implicit Trust in Local Requests:** Applications often trust requests from the server itself or internals IPs, assuming they are safe.
* **Reduced Authentication**: Some services relax authentication for internal requests, allowing full access without full validation.&#x20;
* **Misconfigured Access Controls:** Internal resources may lack strict access controls, assuming they are unreachable externally.&#x20;
* **Weak Validation:** Applications may have weak URL validation, enabling attackers to redirect requests to internal endpoints.&#x20;
