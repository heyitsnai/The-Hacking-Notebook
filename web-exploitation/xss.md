# XSS

### **Types of XSS**

* Stored XSS (Persistent XSS)
  * This is the most critical type of Cross-Site Scripting. Malicious payloads are saved in the database, and triggered whenever users visit the effected page.&#x20;
* Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)
  * This type of XSS isn't as critical, but still dangerous as an attacker can send a link to the user with the payload attached, which can result in stolen session cookies, account hijacking, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.&#x20;
* DOM XSS (Non-Persistent)
  * This type of XSS is when it is done purely on the client side. The vulnerability exists when the application directly manipulates the DOM based on improperly sanitized user input, such as data from the URL or user input. Attackers can use this to execute scripts, steal data, or perform other malicious actions in the userâ€™s browser.

### Simple XSS Payloads

```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

* Using `window.origin` in the alert reveals the exact URL where the payload executes, helping identify the vulnerable form if an iframe is involved. This is especially helpful when the website uses Cross Domain iFrames for user input.&#x20;

```html
<img src="" onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```

* We do **not** necessarily have to perform the alert within the script tag.
* Note: Just because these _**specific**_ payloads did not work doesn't mean that the application doesn't have an XSS vulnerability!
